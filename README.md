# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## This Repository

This repository is in reference to the coding quiz application built for week 4 of Georgia Tech's coding bootcamp. 

This was a very tough assigment and there are many things I would like to continue tweaking style-wise. Future iterations of this will include noises or a brief flash of red on the card for incorrect answers as well as a "restart game" button to play again without needing to refresh the page completely.

The most difficult part of this was without a doubt getting the timer to function as intended. I'll be honest, it's still not perfect as the timer does continue counting down to zero after a user hits the end game screen. I couldn't figure a way to get that to stop, so I just hid the timer element as it has no impact on anything after the game has already ended. 

Acceptance criteria below was included with assignment.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
